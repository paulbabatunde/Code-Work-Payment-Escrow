# Code Bounty Escrow Smart Contract

A secure escrow system for managing code bounties on the Stacks blockchain. This smart contract enables developers to post bounties for coding work and automatically handles fund escrow, submission verification, and payment release.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Escrow**: Funds are held in the contract until work is verified and approved
- **Flexible Verification**: Bounty creators or approved verifiers can validate submissions
- **Deadline Management**: Built-in deadline enforcement for timely completion
- **Submission Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all submissions and verifications
- **Refund Protection**: Creators can cancel open bounties and receive refunds
- **Multi-Verifier Support**: Contract owner can designate trusted third-party verifiers

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Overview

### Core Components

1. **Bounty Management**: Create, track, and manage coding bounties
2. **Submission System**: Developers submit their completed work with documentation
3. **Verification Process**: Authorized parties verify and approve submissions
4. **Payment Release**: Automatic STX transfer upon successful verification
5. **Cancellation System**: Safe cancellation and refund mechanism

### Data Structures

- **Bounties**: Store bounty details, requirements, deadlines, and status
- **Submissions**: Track submitted work with URLs and verification status
- **Verifiers**: Manage approved third-party verifiers

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd code-bounty-escrow
```

2. Initialize Clarinet project (if not already done):
```bash
clarinet new bounty-escrow
cd bounty-escrow
```

3. Add the contract to your `Clarinet.toml`:
```toml
[contracts.bounty-escrow]
path = "contracts/bounty-escrow.clar"
```

### Testing

```bash
clarinet test
```

The test suite covers:
- Bounty creation and validation
- Work submission workflows
- Verification and payment processes
- Authorization and security checks
- Edge cases and error handling

### Deployment

1. **Testnet Deployment**:

clarinet deploy --testnet
```

2. **Mainnet Deployment**:
```bash
clarinet deploy --mainnet
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Creating a Bounty

```clarity
;; Create a 5 STX bounty for a React app
(contract-call? .bounty-escrow create-bounty 
    u5000000  ;; 5 STX in microSTX
    "React Todo App"
    "Build a responsive todo application with React and TypeScript"
    "Must include: React 18+, TypeScript, responsive design, unit tests, README"
    u1000)    ;; Deadline at block 1000
```

### Submitting Work

```clarity
;; Submit completed work
(contract-call? .bounty-escrow submit-work 
    u1  ;; Bounty ID
    "https://github.com/developer/react-todo-app"
    "Completed React todo app with all requirements. Includes comprehensive tests and documentation.")
```

### Verifying Submission

```clarity
;; Verify and release payment (as bounty creator or approved verifier)
(contract-call? .bounty-escrow verify-submission 
    u1  ;; Bounty ID
    'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM)  ;; Submitter address
```
